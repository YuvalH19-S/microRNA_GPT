# microRNA_GPT

This repository contains scripts and tools for collecting, filtering, and extracting biological features from microRNA data, as well as for training GPT models on this data.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

The initial script, `preapare_data_gff.ipynb`, is designed to collect microRNA data from various sources, apply a series of filters to ensure data quality, and extract relevant biological features for further analysis. This script lays the foundation for generating a high-quality dataset suitable for training machine learning models, including GPT-based architectures, to predict or analyze microRNA sequences.

## [Placeholder for Training Scripts]

Training scripts and methodologies will be added here. These scripts will detail the process for training GPT models on the prepared microRNA dataset, including model configuration, training parameters, and evaluation techniques.
